    How can one fathom your Fathomless being?</br>
    How can we know you we see with gross eyes?</br>
    A glimpse of your shadow has blinded ouir seeing;</br>
    How can your Glory ere be realized.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    Thoughts cannot reach you and words cannot speak you,</br>
    Infinite ocean of unending bliss.</br>
    Though we beseech you you, how can we seek you?</br>
    How can the finite know limitlessness?</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    At your command, suns and stars give their light;</br>
    What in the worlds can I offer as mine?</br>
    Even my gift of love would be naught in your sight,</br>
    But veiled reflections of your Love Divine.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    You are the Ancient One, Lord of Creation,</br>
    How can we measure your true majesty?</br>
    You are the Christ, the Divine Incarnation,</br>
    Dear Lord, please don't be indifferent to me.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    You are the beginning and end of all things;</br>
    â€˜Tis you alone who assumes every role.</br>
    Sinners and saints, beggars and kings,</br>
    You are the Source and you are the Goal.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    How can we know you we see with gross eyes?</br>
    A glimpse of your shadow has blinded our seeing;</br>

    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.   </br>
