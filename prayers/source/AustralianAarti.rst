    O glorious, eternal Ancient One </br>
    Your face is a bright, transcendental Sun</br>
    Lighten this dark world and the tears I weep;</br>
    My heart, Meher, I give to you to keep.</br></br>

    Creator, yet creationless you are</br>
    Truth and Truth's Body, divine Avatar</br>
    Who, through compassion the three worlds maintains</br>
    Destroy this ignorance that life sustains.</br></br>

    These five lights are the whirling spokes of breath</br>
    Of the worlds-wheel that bears me on to death</br>
    Unless you, who are infinitely kind</br>
    Break the wheel's hub which is conditioned mind.</br></br>

    This incense is my love, these fruits my art</br>
    Which to please you I have shaped from my heart</br>
    Accept them as you would a simple flower</br>
    That has no use beyond its shining hour.</br></br>

    You are my Self, I sing to you in praise</br>
    And beg your love to bear me through the days</br>
    Till you, the Everliving Perfect One</br>
    Illume my darkness with your shining Sun.</br></br>
