    O Parvardigar! The Preserver and Protector of All,</br>
    You are without beginning and without end.</br>
    </br>
    Non-dual, beyond comparison,</br>
    and none can measure You.</br>
    </br>
    You are without color, without expression,</br>
    without form and without attributes.</br>
    </br>
    You are unlimited and unfathomable; </br>
    beyond imagination and conception;</br>
    eternal and imperishable.</br>
    </br>
    You are indivisible;</br>
    and none can see you but with eyes divine.</br>
    </br>
    You always were, You always are,</br>
    and You always will be.</br>
    </br>
    You are everywhere, You are in everything, and</br>
    You are also beyond everywhere and beyond everything.</br>
    </br>
    You are in the firmament and in the depths,</br>
    You are manifest and unmanifest;</br>
    on all planes and beyond all planes.</br>
    </br>
    You are in the three worlds,</br>
    and also beyond the three worlds.</br>
    </br>
    You are imperceptible and independent.</br>
    You are the Creator, the Lord of Lords,</br>
    the Knower of all minds and hearts.</br>
    </br>
    You are Omnipotent and Omnipresent.</br>
    You are Knowledge Infinite, Power Infinite and Bliss Infinite.</br>
    </br>
    You are the Ocean of Knowledge,</br>
    All-knowing, Infinitely-knowing;</br>
    the Knower of the past, the present and the future;</br>
    and You are Knowledge itself.</br>
    </br>
    You are all-merciful and eternally benevolent.</br>
    You are the Soul of souls, the One with infinite attributes.</br>
    </br>
    You are the Trinity of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss;</br>
    You are the Source of Truth, the Ocean of Love.</br>
    </br>
    You are the Ancient One, the Highest of the High.</br>
    You are Prabhu and Parameshwar;</br>
    You are the Beyond God and the Beyond-Beyond God also;</br>
    You are Parabrahma, Allah, Elahi, Yezdan,</br>
    Ahuramazda, and God the Beloved.</br>
    </br>
    You are named Ezad, the Only One Worthy of Worship. </br>
