    </br>
    We repent, O God most merciful; for all our sins;</br>
    for every thought that was false or unjust or unclean;</br>
    for every word spoken that ought not to have been spoken;</br>
    for every deed done that ought not to have been done.</br></br>

    We repent for every deed and word and thought inspired by selfishness,</br>
    and for every deed and word and thought inspired by hatred.</br></br>

    We repent most specially for every lustful thought and every lustful action;</br>
    for every lie; for all hypocrisy;</br>
    for every promise given but not fulfilled,</br>
    and for all slander and back-biting.</br></br>

    Most specially also, we repent for every action that has brought ruin to others;</br>
    for every word and deed that has given others pain;</br>
    and for every wish that pain should befall others.</br></br>

    In your unbounded mercy, we ask you to forgive us, O God,</br>
    for all these sins committed by us,</br>
    and to forgive us for our constant failures</br>
    to think and speak and act according to your will.</br>
    </br>
