    </br></br>
    O Parvardigar! The Preserver and Protector of All,</br>
    You are without beginning and without end.</br>
    </br>
    Non-dual, beyond comparison,</br>
    and none can measure You.</br>
    </br>
    You are without color, without expression,</br>
    without form and without attributes.</br>
    </br>
    You are unlimited and unfathomable; </br>
    beyond imagination and conception;</br>
    eternal and imperishable.</br>
    </br>
    You are indivisible;</br>
    and none can see you but with eyes divine.</br>
    </br>
    You always were, You always are,</br>
    and You always will be.</br>
    </br>
    You are everywhere, You are in everything, and</br>
    You are also beyond everywhere and beyond everything.</br>
    </br>
    You are in the firmament and in the depths,</br>
    You are manifest and unmanifest;</br>
    on all planes and beyond all planes.</br>
    </br>
    You are in the three worlds,</br>
    and also beyond the three worlds.</br>
    </br>
    You are imperceptible and independent.</br>
    You are the Creator, the Lord of Lords,</br>
    the Knower of all minds and hearts.</br>
    </br>
    You are Omnipotent and Omnipresent.</br>
    You are Knowledge Infinite, Power Infinite and Bliss Infinite.</br>
    </br>
    You are the Ocean of Knowledge,</br>
    All-knowing, Infinitely-knowing;</br>
    the Knower of the past, the present and the future;</br>
    and You are Knowledge itself.</br>
    </br>
    You are all-merciful and eternally benevolent.</br>
    You are the Soul of souls, the One with infinite attributes.</br>
    </br>
    You are the Trinity of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss;</br>
    You are the Source of Truth, the Ocean of Love.</br>
    </br>
    You are the Ancient One, the Highest of the High.</br>
    You are Prabhu and Parameshwar;</br>
    You are the Beyond God and the Beyond-Beyond God also;</br>
    You are Parabrahma, Allah, Elahi, Yezdan,</br>
    Ahuramazda, and God the Beloved.</br>
    </br>
    You are named Ezad, the Only One Worthy of Worship. </br>
    </br></br>


Prayer of Repentance
====================

**Given by Meher Baba on 8 November 1952**

.. raw:: html

    </br></br>
    We repent, O God most merciful; for all our sins;</br>
    for every thought that was false or unjust or unclean;</br>
    for every word spoken that ought not to have been spoken;</br>
    for every deed done that ought not to have been done.</br></br>

    We repent for every deed and word and thought inspired by selfishness,</br>
    and for every deed and word and thought inspired by hatred.</br></br>

    We repent most specially for every lustful thought and every lustful action;</br>
    for every lie; for all hypocrisy;</br>
    for every promise given but not fulfilled,</br>
    and for all slander and back-biting.</br></br>

    Most specially also, we repent for every action that has brought ruin to others;</br>
    for every word and deed that has given others pain;</br>
    and for every wish that pain should befall others.</br></br>

    In your unbounded mercy, we ask you to forgive us, O God,</br>
    for all these sins committed by us,</br>
    and to forgive us for our constant failures</br>
    to think and speak and act according to your will.</br>
    </br></br>

==================

    </br>
    Beloved God, help us all to love You more and more, </br>
    and more and more and still yet more, </br>
    till we become worthy of union with You; </br>
    and help us all to hold fast to Baba's daaman till the very end. 
    </br></br>


The Australian Aarti
====================

**By Francis Brabazon**

    </br></br>
    O glorious, eternal Ancient One </br>
    Your face is a bright, transcendental Sun</br>
    Lighten this dark world and the tears I weep;</br>
    My heart, Meher, I give to you to keep.</br></br>

    Creator, yet creationless you are</br>
    Truth and Truth's Body, divine Avatar</br>
    Who, through compassion the three worlds maintains</br>
    Destroy this ignorance that life sustains.</br></br>

    These five lights are the whirling spokes of breath</br>
    Of the worlds-wheel that bears me on to death</br>
    Unless you, who are infinitely kind</br>
    Break the wheel's hub which is conditioned mind.</br></br>

    This incense is my love, these fruits my art</br>
    Which to please you I have shaped from my heart</br>
    Accept them as you would a simple flower</br>
    That has no use beyond its shining hour.</br></br>

    You are my Self, I sing to you in praise</br>
    And beg your love to bear me through the days</br>
    Till you, the Everliving Perfect One</br>
    Illume my darkness with your shining Sun.</br></br>
    </br></br>

    How can one fathom your Fathomless being?</br>

    </br>

    </br>

    Thoughts cannot reach you and words cannot speak you,</br>

    </br>

    At your command, suns and stars give their light;</br>
    What in the worlds can I offer as mine?</br>
    Even my gift of love would be naught in your sight,</br>
    But veiled reflections of your Love Divine.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>

    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    You are the Ancient One, Lord of Creation,</br>
    How can we measure your true majesty?</br>
    You are the Christ, the Divine Incarnation,</br>
    Dear Lord, please don't be indifferent to me.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    You are the beginning and end of all things;</br>
    â€˜Tis you alone who assumes every role.</br>
    Sinners and saints, beggars and kings,</br>
    You are the Source and you are the Goal.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.</br>
    </br>

    How can one fathom your Fathomless being?</br>
    How can we know you we see with gross eyes?</br>
    A glimpse of your shadow has blinded our seeing;</br>
    How can your Glory ere be realized.</br>
    </br>

    Consumed is my mind in your fire and flame;</br>
    Accept it O Meher, in Oneness.</br>
    Consumed is my heart in the sound your name.</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my Arti;</br>
    Accept, O Meher, my song.   </br>
